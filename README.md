# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
Performing analysis on Kickstarter data to uncover trends

## Overview of Project
Louise is looking to initiate a Kickstarter campaign for her latest creation, a play entitled "Fever".

### Purpose
Louise would like an analysis of recent Kickstarter campaigns to determine if there are any characteristics shared amongst successful campaigns.

## Analysis and Challenges
An analysis was performed on a selection of over 4000 various Kickstarter campaigns, ranging from potential films to unique inventions. A dataset this large definitely proved challenging as there were many methods required to weed out irrelevant data. Fortunately, a smaller, more focused compilation of data was able to be extracted.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

The first analysis looks at Kickstarter campaigns and their rate of success based on launch month. As is immediately noticeable, campaign success rates spike through the summer months, with campaigns launched in May at the peak. As the holiday season approaches however, an obvious dip in success rate occurs beginning in November. Campaign failure rates, however, do not show any particular trend based solely on time of the year.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
